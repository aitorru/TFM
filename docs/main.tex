    \section{Abstract}
    JavaScript has emerged as a fundamental language in global development. Much of the success of Node.js, both in server-side applications and full-stack web applications (client-server), can be attributed to it.

    Node.js was primarily created to enable JavaScript to run on the server. The creator of Node never anticipated that JavaScript would be used for literally everything.

    JavaScript is employed in desktop applications using Electron, and in mobile applications using React Native or Ionic. As an interpreted language, it has a low entry barrier. As the default language of the web, it also boasts a wealth of interesting libraries.

    All these factors have contributed to the rise of JavaScript as the language of the future. Nonetheless, as the creator himself contends, it has experienced some 'growing pains'.
